# Web Development Foundations: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet

## Overview

This project is a hands-on challenge to build your own HTML/CSS cheat sheet, serving as a personal reference for web development.  The goal is to create a resource that help us quickly recall important concepts as we build more websites in the future.

## Project Goals

- Build a personalized reference cheat sheet for HTML and CSS
- Document at least one HTML or CSS topic
- Use HTML tables for clear, organized documentation
- Apply a custom color scheme and code styling

## Prerequisites

- **Completion of the Codecademy Introduction to HTML course** (through the HTML tables lesson)
- **Completion of the Learn CSS: Selectors and Visual Rules lessons**

## Project Requirements

1. **Document at least one HTML or CSS topic**
   - Examples: HTML Tables, other HTML tags, CSS selectors and specificity, common CSS properties
2. **Use HTML tables to display documentation**
   - Label your columns (e.g., Tag, Name, Description)
3. **Apply a custom color scheme**
   - Use named CSS colors for styling
  
## Example Table Structure

| Tag                | Name               | Description                |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
| ``                 | ` ... `            | Creates an HTML table      |
| ``                 | ` ... `            | Defines a table row        |
| ``                 | ` ... `            | Defines a table cell       |


## Solution

There is no single “correct” solution—every cheat sheet might look different from others, and that’s encouraged!
